Star U was a project by Payton Turner and JD Bennett that is a web application designed for people to rate and review their peers or 
acquaintances. This application has functionality for users to signup and login to an account they have created. 
By creating an account they can then make a profile that will be shown to all other users of the application for them to use review. 
The user creates their profile with their username and a description of themselves and a profile picture to show who they are.
Since the reviews for these people comes from in-person experiences there is not much information for the person to display. 
The application also has a search mechanic which allows for easier searching of a username. When reviews are made by other users. They will
be posted in the reviews section where all reviews will be seen with their star rating and complete reviews made by others. 
Additional features that were added to the project were a star rating, search bar, and image uploader. while being a simple application,
Star U accomplishes what it was intended to do.
